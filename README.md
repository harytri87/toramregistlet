# How to Use:
1. Update file [Registlet.csv](./Registlet/Registlet.csv).  
_(Manually adding & crosschecking. Use excel, Google Sheets or even notepad lol)_
2. Input [Registlet.csv](./Registlet/Registlet.csv) and [Registlet.md](./Registlet/Registlet.md) to [index.html](./index.html)  
_(web app)_
3. You get the result
   - Updated with new registlets you added to [Registlet.csv](./Registlet/Registlet.csv)
   - List Stoodie lv where you can get that registlet automatically updated

**Not fully automated:**
- Refer to the first step
- Manually fix the list order  
_(copy paste to rearrange the list in [Registlet.md](./Registlet/Registlet.md))_  

## How to Fix the List Order:
**Manually fix the list order.**  
- When Asobimo updates new registlets, do the steps from [How to Use](#how-to-use).  
It will automatically update the list without ruining the list order that you have fixed  
_(if you input that fixed md file)_
- If Asobimo changed existing registlet's name, make sure to change it both on [Registlet.csv](./Registlet/Registlet.csv) and [Registlet.md](./Registlet/Registlet.md) before uploading it.


# Why Markdown File?
1. Javascript can read it as a plain text
2. Easier to update _(make use of regex)_
3. Easily formated to looks good with simple symbols


***Notes:***  
Current [Registlet.md](./Registlet/Registlet.md) order is messy and the details not completed _(the list is completed tho)_.  
I haven't unlocked a lot of registlets, so I can't write the details.  
Also, I know the app looks bad lol
