> **TL;DR:**  
> This app only help to automate update list of Stoodie level on existing registlets and add new registlets to the list. Not including registlet descriptions.

# How to Use:
1. Download these files (if you don't have them)
    - <a href="./Registlet/Registlet.csv" target="_blank">Registlet.csv</a>
    - <a href="./Registlet/Registlet.md" target="_blank">Registlet.md</a>  
        <small>_To download <code>Registlet.md</code> after clicking link above:_  
            - _PC: ctrl+s to download. Make sure it's <code>.md</code>, not <code>.txt</code>._  
            - _Mobile: find download page button on your browser._</small>
2. Update file <code>Registlet.csv</code>.  
    <small>_(Manually adding & crosschecking. Use excel, Google Sheets or even notepad)_</small>
3. Upload <code>Registlet.csv</code> and <code>Registlet.md</code> then click submit.
4. You get the result
   - Updated with new registlets you added to <code>Registlet.csv</code>
   - List Stoodie lv where you can get that registlet automatically updated

**Not fully automated:**
- Refer to the second step
- In the fourth step, youâ€™ll need to manually add the registlet description.  
    <small>_(Just one time thing, and only for new registlets or ones that got changes if Asobimo updates them.)_</small>
- Manually fix the list order  
    <small>_(copy paste to rearrange the list in <code>Registlet.md</code>)_</small>

## How to Update the List:
- When Asobimo updates new registlets, do the steps from <a href="https://toramregistlet.github.io/update.html#note">How to Use</a>.  
It will automatically update the list without ruining the list order that you have fixed _(if you upload that fixed <code>.md</code> file)_
- If Asobimo changed existing registlet's name, make sure to change it both on <code>Registlet.csv</code> and <code>Registlet.md</code> before uploading them.
